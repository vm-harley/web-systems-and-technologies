<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the standard language used to create and design webpages. </p>
<p>It provides the basic structure of web pages, using a series of elements and tags to define content. </p>
<p>HTML is often used in combination with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for functionality) to create fully interactive and visually appealing web pages.</p>
